The book is 3.5 cm thick, consisting of 400 pages of paper. While early examples of these pages contain introductory material such as copyright information and 
dedications, by page 9 the main book content begins in the form of the first chapter. The book continues on in a 
similar fashion, although at times does make changes in the font and the typesetting used.
